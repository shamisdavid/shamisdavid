# 👋 Hi, I'm David Shamis

I'm a UC Berkeley-certified Machine Learning & AI professional and a full-stack web developer trained at AppAcademy. I’m passionate about applying machine learning, NLP, and modern development tools to solve real-world problems and create meaningful user experiences.

I transitioned into tech after years of hands-on work as an automotive technician—an experience that sharpened my ability to work under pressure, think systematically, and solve complex problems. I now bring that same mindset to building and debugging intelligent systems and full-stack applications.
